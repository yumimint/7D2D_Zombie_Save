# 7D2D Zombie Save - Save Game Manager for 7 Days to Die

## Overview

7D2D Zombie Save is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python and Tkinter, designed to help players of the game "7 Days to Die" manage their save game data. It allows users to easily list, back up, and restore their game saves, providing a safety net against data loss or corruption.

## Features

- **List Save Games**: Automatically detects and lists your "7 Days to Die" save games, showing the save name and the world name.
- **Create Backups**: Create compressed ZIP backups of selected save games. Backups are timestamped for easy identification (e.g., `MySaveGame_YYYYMMDDTHHMM.zip`).
- **List Backups**: Displays a list of all available backups, sorted by date.
- **Restore from Backup**: Easily restore a game save from a selected backup file. The tool handles the deletion of the existing save (if any) and extracts the backup to the correct location.
- **Open Folders**: Provides quick buttons to open:
  - The "7 Days to Die" saves folder (`%APPDATA%\7DaysToDie\Saves`).
  - The application's backup folder (located in a `7D2DBackups` subdirectory where the script is run).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI for managing saves and backups.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Primarily designed for Windows (due to reliance on `%APPDATA%` and `os.startfile`).
- **Python**: Python 3.x. _(Could you specify a minimum Python version, e.g., Python 3.7+?)_
- **Standard Libraries**: Uses common Python libraries like `tkinter`, `os`, `shutil`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `zipfile`, which are typically included with Python. No external packages are strictly required for basic functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `7D2D Zombie Save.pyw` file. This should launch the GUI.
    - On Windows, running a `.pyw` file usually means it will run with `pythonw.exe`, which doesn't open a console window.
2. **Main Window**:
    - The left list displays your current "7 Days to Die" save games.
    - The right list displays available backups.
    - The middle column contains action buttons.
3. **Creating a Backup**:
    - Select a save game from the **left list** ("セーブデータリスト").
    - Click the **"バックアップ" (Backup)** button.
    - A timestamped ZIP file of your save will be created in the `7D2DBackups` folder.
4. **Restoring a Backup**:
    - Select a backup file from the **right list** ("バックアップリスト").
    - Click the **"復元" (Restore)** button.
    - Confirm the action. The selected backup will be restored, overwriting the current save data for that game if it exists.
5. **Refreshing Lists**:
    - Click the **"リストを更新" (Reload)** button to refresh both the save game list and the backup list.
6. **Opening Folders**:
    - Use the **"バックアップフォルダを開く" (Open Backup Folder)** or **"Saves フォルダを開く" (Open Saves Folder)** buttons for quick access.

## Folder Structure

- **Game Saves Location**: The application looks for "7 Days to Die" saves in the standard Windows location: `%APPDATA%\7DaysToDie\Saves`.
- **Backups Location**: Backups are stored in a folder named `7D2DBackups`, which is created in the same directory where the `7D2D Zombie Save.pyw` script is located.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Currently, the application is primarily designed and tested for Windows. While some parts might work on other OSes, the default save path detection is Windows-specific.
- If "7 Days to Die" significantly changes its save game folder structure in future updates, this tool might require an update.
